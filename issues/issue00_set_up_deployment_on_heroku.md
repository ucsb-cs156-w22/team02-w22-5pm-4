Set up a team deployments for prod and qa on Heroku

# Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] The main branch is deployed on Heroku at, for example,
      <https://w22-5pm-1-team02.herokuapp.com> (substituting your
      own team name for `w22-5pm-1`), and is set up for automatic
      deployment.  This is the so-called `prod` deployment.
- [ ] All members of the team are added to the Heroku `prod` deployment.
- [ ] The course instructor (`phtcon@ucsb.edu`) and the mentor listed
      at <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/w22/info/teams/> is added to
      the heroku `prod` deployment. (Ask for the email they use with
      Heroku via slack.)
- [ ] There is also a deployment at, for example,
      <https://w22-5pm-1-team02-qa.herokuapp.com> (substituting your
      own team name for `w22-5pm-1`).  This deployment can be used
      by the team for `qa` of work in progress.  The team can use 
      it's slack channel to coordinate which branch is deployed there
      at any given time.
- [ ] The course instructor (`phtcon@ucsb.edu`) and the mentor listed
      at <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/w22/info/teams/> is added to
      the heroku `qa` deployment. (Ask for the email they use with
      Heroku via slack.)
- [ ] Links to the `prod` and `qa` deployments are added near the top
      of the `README.md` of your `team02` repo.  (Do this via a PR; 
      don't just edit the main branch.)
